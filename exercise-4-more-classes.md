# More classes

Sure, here's a set of exercises that might help a beginner Java programmer understand how to instantiate objects. Before starting the exercises, ensure you understand the basics of Java, such as classes, variables, methods, and constructors.

1. **Array of Objects**

   Building on the previous exercise, create an array of `Car` objects. Populate the array with at least five different `Car` objects, and then use a loop to call the `printDetails` method on each car in the array.

2. **Object with Objects**

   Create a `Person` class with two attributes: `name` (a String) and `car` (a Car object). Make sure to add a constructor to the `Person` class that allows you to set these attributes when instantiating a `Person` object. Then, instantiate two `Person` objects in the main method, each with different `name` and `car` attributes. Finally, add a method `printDetails` in `Person` class to print the person's name and details of the car they own.

3. **Object Interaction**

   In the `Person` class, add a method `drive`. This method should print out a message saying the person's name and that they're driving, and then call the `Car`'s `printDetails` method. For example, if a Person named `"John"` is driving a `"2022 Tesla"`, the `drive` method should print out something like `"John is driving a 2022 Tesla"`.

By progressively working through these exercises, you should get a more solid understanding of how to instantiate and use objects in Java. Remember, practice makes perfect. Happy coding!
