# Creating more classes

Here are some exercises on creating classes and instantiating them:

1. Create a class called `Person` with instance variables `name` and `age`. Instantiate a `Person` object and assign values to the instance variables.

2. Create a class called `Car` with instance variables `make`, `model`, and `year`. Instantiate a `Car` object and assign values to the instance variables.

3. Create a class called `Rectangle` with instance variables `length` and `width`. Instantiate a `Rectangle` object and assign values to the instance variables.

4. Create a class called `BankAccount` with instance variables `accountNumber` and `balance`. Instantiate a `BankAccount` object and assign values to the instance variables.

5. Create a class called `Dog` with instance variables `name` and `breed`. Instantiate a `Dog` object and assign values to the instance variables.

As a bonus exercise, you could try combining some of these classes! For example, you could create a `Person` class with an instance variable of type `Car` to represent a person's car. Then you could instantiate a `Person` object and a `Car` object, and set the person's car instance variable to the `Car` object you instantiated.
